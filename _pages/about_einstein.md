I am a PhD student in the [Neuroscience PhD program at UC Berkeley](https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/home), working on Systems/Computational neuroscience. I am a Berkeley Doctoral Fellow and I am currently supported by the NIH T32 Training Grant.

Before joining UC Berkeley, I earned a MS degree in Computer Science at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), with a major in Machine Intelligence and a minor in Theoretical Computer Science, where I developed my interest in Computational Neuroscience.

During my Master's, I spent a semester working as a research intern in [IBM Research Zurich](https://research.ibm.com/labs/zurich), where I developed and analyized bio-inspired algorithms for deep neural networks.

I wrote my Master's thesis in the [Kreiman Lab](https://klab.tch.harvard.edu) at Harvard, where I developed and analyzed a biologically-inspired Hebbian attractor model of working memory, matching human behavioral data and neurophysiological properties. During this time I was also part of the 2023 [Brains, Minds and Machine Summer Course](https://cbmm.mit.edu/summer-school/2023).
